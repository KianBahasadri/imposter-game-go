# imposter-game-go


this is my first time using go
please dont cry

i based the logic off of the hub example from the gorillas library

/:
"please set your username"
button -> join so-and-so's game
button -> create game

when game is created, a hub is created and set

/game?game="username's game":
stateful game cycle until end screen
websocket -> live update etc.
